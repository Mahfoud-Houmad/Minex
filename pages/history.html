            <h3>1901-1907</h3>
            <h4>Early Geological Observations</h4>
            <p>
              French geologist Abel Brives traveled across southern Morocco,
              particularly in the Chichaoua and Imin Tanout regions. He
              carefully mapped geological formations and noticed unusual
              mineral-rich layers that hinted at the presence of phosphates.
              Although the technology and infrastructure to exploit these
              deposits did not yet exist, Brives’ surveys provided the first
              scientific basis for further exploration. His reports sparked
              interest among mining companies and colonial authorities. This
              period represents the conceptual birth of Morocco’s phosphate
              story.

            <h3>1912</h3>
            <h4>Official Discovery near El Borouj</h4>
            <p>
              In 1912, geologists MM. Combelas and Lamolinerie confirmed the
              first commercially viable phosphate deposits west of Oued Zem,
              near El Borouj. The discovery came as Morocco entered the French
              Protectorate era, opening doors for foreign investment in mining.
              This moment transformed phosphate from a geological curiosity into
              a strategic industrial resource. The location’s proximity to
              potential transport routes made it ideal for future exploitation.
              It laid the groundwork for Khouribga to become the heart of
              Moroccan phosphate production for decades.

            <h3>August 20, 1920</h3>
            <h4>Creation of the Office Chérifien (OCP)</h4>
            <p>
              By royal decree, the Moroccan state established the OCP to manage,
              regulate, and develop the phosphate sector. This new entity was
              charged with turning the promising discoveries of the previous
              decade into a structured, large-scale industry. With state backing
              and foreign expertise, OCP began recruiting engineers, building
              administrative centers, and planning extraction sites. The
              organization’s creation marked a turning point, giving Morocco an
              institutional tool to harness its phosphate wealth. OCP would go
              on to become a global leader in the industry.

            <h3>March 1921</h3>
            <h4>Launch of Mining at Khouribga</h4>
            <p>
              In March 1921, OCP opened its first mining site in Khouribga, with
              operations managed from nearby Boujniba. The mine’s location was
              chosen for its high-quality deposits and accessibility to planned
              railway lines. Early operations were labor-intensive, relying on
              both Moroccan workers and imported technical expertise. Within
              months, the site was producing significant quantities of raw
              phosphate ready for processing. This marked Morocco’s entry into
              organized, industrial-scale phosphate production, setting the
              stage for rapid growth in the sector.

            <h3>1921</h3>
            <h4>First Export via Casablanca</h4>
            <p>
              Just months after mining began, the first shipments of Moroccan
              phosphate left through the port of Casablanca. This achievement
              was made possible by the rapid construction of transport
              infrastructure, including a dedicated railway from Khouribga to
              the coast. Exporting phosphate positioned Morocco as an emerging
              supplier in the international fertilizer market. These early
              exports also demonstrated the OCP’s efficiency in integrating
              mining, logistics, and trade. From this point onward, phosphate
              became a key pillar of Morocco’s economic strategy.

            <h4>Opening of Youssoufia Mine</h4>
            <p>
              A decade after Khouribga’s debut, OCP expanded by opening the
              Youssoufia mine, strategically located to diversify production and
              reduce dependency on a single site. This expansion required new
              infrastructure, from extraction facilities to worker housing, and
              it further strengthened Morocco’s role in the global phosphate
              market. The addition of Youssoufia increased overall output
              capacity and ensured greater stability in supply. It also marked
              the beginning of Morocco’s multi-site mining operations, a model
              still in use today.

            <p>
              After initial phosphate discovery, large-scale industrial mining
              began in Khouribga with the establishment of basic extraction and
              transport infrastructure. This marked the transition from small
              exploratory work to a full-fledged mining industry. Early
              mechanization and rail connections to Casablanca port allowed
              Morocco to enter the international phosphate market. The site
              rapidly grew into the cornerstone of national phosphate
              production.

              To meet increasing demand, OCP expanded operations to the
              Youssoufia mine, diversifying production locations. This period
              saw investment in new infrastructure, including worker housing,

            Founded in 1920 as the Office Chérifien des Phosphates, OCP has
            grown from operating a single mine in Khouribga to becoming a global
            leader in the phosphate industry. Over the decades, the company
            expanded its mining operations to Youssoufia (1931) and Benguerir
            (1976), while also developing world-class chemical processing hubs
            in Safi (1965) and Jorf Lasfar (1984). Today, OCP operates across
            five continents, managing every stage of the phosphate value chain —
            from extraction and transformation to logistics, education, and
            community development. Owned by the Moroccan Government and Banque
            Populaire du Maroc since 2008, OCP continues to drive economic
            growth while committing to environmental stewardship and fostering
            innovation in partnership with local and global stakeholders.
