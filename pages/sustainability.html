          <h3>Circular Resource Management</h3>
          <p>
            By embracing circular economy principles, OCP is closing the loop on
            phosphate use. We reintegrate waste streams back into processing
            cycles, recover phosphorus from wastewater, and continually optimize
            resource efficiency—an approach that minimizes waste and maximizes
            value across the entire life cycle of mining and manufacturing.

          <div class="pillar-vline" aria-hidden="true"></div>
          <div class="pillar-richtext">
            <p>
              Aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, OCP has
              developed a Circular Economy Program centered on four pillars:
              resource conservation, sustainable production, education for
              intelligent consumption, and value creation through efficient
              processing and recycling. This includes reintegrating
              low-phosphorus waste rock into beneficiation cycles and recovering
              phosphorus from wastewater and organic residues—a forward-thinking
              approach to resource stewardship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond waste reintegration, OCP is researching the transformation
              of byproducts such as gypsum into industrial materials like cement
              or agricultural soil amendments, minimizing waste and multiplying
              value streams. This initiative underscores how environmental
              responsibility can drive new economic opportunities across
              phosphate value chains.

          <h3>Advanced Extraction & Beneficiation</h3>
          <p>
            OCP prioritizes efficiency from the ground up. Through precision
            beneficiation techniques—like high-performance washing and
            flotation—we extract more from every deposit, even lower-grade ore.
            This strategic refinement extends mine lifespan while reducing
            energy use and environmental impact.

            <p>
              OCP employs precision beneficiation techniques—including modern
              washing and flotation—to drastically improve the viability of
              lower-grade phosphate ores. These methods have turned previously
              uneconomical 33%-grade ores into productive assets while
              optimizing energy consumption and extraction efficacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The implementation of such technological advancements reinforces
              resource longevity, reduces environmental footprints, and enables
              OCP to meet global phosphate demand sustainably—without
              accelerating resource depletion or increasing ecological strain.
