      <p>
        Crushing is the initial step in the beneficiation process where the
        mined phosphate rock is reduced in size to make further treatment easier
        and more effective. Once the raw material arrives from the mine, it
        often contains large lumps of rock mixed with smaller fragments and
        impurities. Crushing breaks down these lumps into smaller, more uniform
        pieces, which increases the surface area for subsequent processing
        steps. This improved particle size helps in the separation of valuable
        phosphate minerals from unwanted materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a technical standpoint, the goal is to achieve an optimal size that
        maximizes efficiency in washing, screening, and flotation. Too coarse,
        and the mineral remains locked within the rock; too fine, and the
        particles may become difficult to handle and lead to material losses.
      </p>

      <p>
        This stage also plays a role in homogenizing the feed material, ensuring
        consistent quality in later stages. Although energy-intensive, modern
        practices aim to minimize environmental impacts by reducing dust
        emissions and optimizing energy use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crushing prepares the phosphate ore for the next stages, where the real
        separation of mineral and waste begins.
