        Raw wet-process phosphoric acid contains dissolved impurities (Fe, Al,
        Mg, organic carbon, fluoride) from the rock and acid. Purification
        removes these to meet end-use specifications. Typically, the weak acid
        (∼25% P₂O₅) is first clarified by allowing fine solids to settle or be
        filtered out. Then chemical treatments (e.g. lime or ammonia
        precipitation) and filtration remove metallic impurities. Many plants
        use filter aids (clays or silicas) and may employ solvent extraction or
        ion-exchange for heavy metals. For example, purification often involves
        passing the acid through coagulant filters and treating it to meet
        purity grades. The result is purified phosphoric acid with drastically
        lower suspended solids and metal content.
      </p>

      <h2>Key steps :</h2>
      <h3>Filtration/Cooling</h3>
      <p>
        The hot filtered acid is often cooled to precipitate or separate some
        salts.
      </p>
      <h3>Chemical treatment:</h3>
      <p>
        Additives cause impurity salts (e.g. aluminum or iron phosphates) to
        precipitate.
      </p>
      <h3>Second filtration:</h3>
      <p>Remove the precipitated impurities.</p>
      <h3>Optional solvent extraction or membrane processes :</h3>
      <p>
        Advanced plants may use solvent extraction or nanofiltration to target
        specific contaminants.
      </p>
      <h3>Water recycling :</h3>
      <p>
        Waste or condensate waters (rich in P and F) are recycled back into the
        process to limit discharges.
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific principles:</h2>
      <p>
        Purification exploits solubility differences: metals and undesirable
        ions form insoluble compounds at controlled pH or temperature and
        precipitate out. Fluorides often remain in solution as HF or
        hexafluorosilicates and require careful handling. The goal is high
        phosphate recovery with minimal losses.
      </p>

      <h2>Concentration :</h2>
      <p>
        After purification, the acid is typically still dilute (~25% P₂O₅). It
        is concentrated by vacuum evaporation or multi-effect evaporators. Here,
        low-pressure boiling drives off water (often recovered as condensate for
        process reuse), raising acid strength to 40–55% P₂O₅ or higher. Multiple
        evaporator stages (feed-forward systems) may be used to improve energy
        efficiency. The purified acid is thereby concentrated to the desired
        grade (often ~54% P₂O₅ for fertilizer grade).
      </p>

      <h2>Integration :</h2>
      <p>
        Concentrated acid often requires heat or vacuum, so it benefits from
        on-site steam and power. Excess steam from the SAP and power plant can
        drive evaporators. The Power Plant supplies electricity and steam; heat
        recovery from acid condensers may be used in desalination or process
        heating. Cooling towers and condensers tie into the plant’s water
        circuit.
      </p>
      <h2>Environmental considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        Evaporation uses substantial heat, so modern plants recover heat via
        multiple stages to reduce fuel use. Off-gases (water vapor, acid mist)
        are condensed and treated; the condensate (often acidic) is recycled for
        scrubbers or dilution water. Purification generates sludge of gypsum or
        metal phosphates; these sludges are often reused (e.g. blended into
        fertilizers) or landfilled in containment areas. By concentrating acid,
        the volume of material shipped is reduced, lowering transport emissions.
        Any residual effluents are neutralized, and solid wastes (like iron
        phosphate or calcium fluoride) are managed under hazardous-waste
        guidelines if needed.
