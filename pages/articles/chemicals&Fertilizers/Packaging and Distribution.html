        After granulation and final screening, fertilizers are handled by
        bagging and bulk loading lines. Most solid fertilizers are packed into
        50-kg or 25-kg bags (woven polypropylene, kraft paper with plastic
        liner, etc.) or loaded in bulk containers. Packaging ensures product
        quality and worker safety. In bagging stations, products are conveyed to
        automatic fillers, sealed, and palletized. Finished bags are
        pallet-stacked and wrapped, or loaded into bulk bags (FIBCs) for
        large-volume shipments.
      </p>

      <h2>Packaging materials:</h2>
      <p>
        Bags are chosen for moisture and UV protection. As noted by industry
        guidelines, bags should be completely emptied (shaken out) before
        disposal. Empty bags can often be recycled or reused if clean.
        Fertilizer manufacturers strive to minimize packaging waste by using
        appropriately sized bags and by participating in bag-recycling programs.
        Spent plastic sacks and liners are collected for recycling or proper
        disposal.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        Packaging and distribution have their own sustainability challenges.
        Wasted fertilizer (spillage) and open bags can pollute soil or water, so
        handling procedures emphasize spill containment. Yara recommends storing
        and transporting fertilizers at least 10 m from surface water and 50 m
        from wells to prevent runoff. Proper dust collection (baghouse filters)
        on bagging lines prevents airborne particulate emissions. Packaging
        materials are often designed to be recyclable (e.g. HDPE, PP marked for
        recycling). Companies follow regulations to triple-rinse any chemical
        containers and to segregate waste by type.
      </p>

      <h2>Distribution:</h2>
      <p>
        Bagged fertilizers are shipped by truck, rail, or ship to distribution
        centers and farmers worldwide. Bulk shipments (ship or rail) minimize
        packaging by loading into covered hopper cars or vessels; bulk terminals
        use conveyors and silos. Labeling ensures safe handling (e.g. “keep
        dry”). Logistics planning optimizes load size and route to reduce carbon
        footprint. Product distribution also involves mixing (blending custom
        NPK fertilizers) at customer sites or terminals. Efficient distribution
        is key to reduce costs and emissions, and many companies track supply
        chains to improve sustainability.

        Each step above plays a vital role in turning mined phosphate into
        usable fertilizers. The acidulation step unlocks phosphorus from rock.
        Purification and concentration ensure the acid meets quality needs.
        Fertilizer manufacturing combines acid with ammonia or additional rock
        to make nutrient products. Finally, packaging and distribution deliver
        the finished fertilizers to markets safely and with minimal waste.
        Throughout, integrated infrastructure (SAP/PAP plants, power and
        desalination units) and attention to environmental management (waste
        water recycling, emission controls, material recycling) ensure an
        efficient and sustainable fertilizer supply chain.
