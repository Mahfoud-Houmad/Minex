        From Acid to Nutrients: Fertilizer Manufacturing of DAP, MAP, and TSP

        Using phosphoric acid from step 2 (Purification and concentration),
        fertilizer plants produce solid phosphate fertilizers with different N:P
        ratios. The major products are DAP (diammonium phosphate, (NH₄)₂HPO₄),
        MAP (monoammonium phosphate, NH₄H₂PO₄) and TSP (triple superphosphate,
        Ca(H₂PO₄)₂·H₂O). These differ by whether ammonia is added and how the
        acid reacts with rock.
      </p>

      <h2>DAP (18-46-0):</h2>
      <p>
        Production begins by reacting hot purified phosphoric acid (about 75–85%
        P₂O₅) with gaseous ammonia in a neutralization reactor. The ideal ratio
        is about 2 mol NH₃ per mol H₃PO₄ (to produce (NH₄)₂HPO₄). The reaction
        is highly exothermic, producing a hot slurry of 65–70% DAP. Off-gases
        containing unreacted ammonia and fine dust pass to a scrubber tower,
        where they are contacted with dilute acid to recover ammonia and capture
        particulates. The hot DAP slurry is then cooled (often in large
        coolers), granulated, and dried. Granulation forms roundish pellets,
        which are then sized by screening. Typical plant steps are:
        pre-neutralization, ammoniation/granulation, scrubbing (to meet
        emissions standards), drying and cooling, and screening to final granule
        size. Throughout, dust is collected via cyclones or baghouses.
      </p>

      <h2>MAP (11-52-0):</h2>
      <p>
        MAP is made similarly but uses a 1:1 molar ratio of NH₃ to H₃PO₄. This
        produces NH₄H₂PO₄ (MAP) slurry, which has slightly different pH (more
        acidic) than DAP. MAP can be produced in a simple pipe reactor or rotary
        drum, then granulated. One advantage is that MAP requires only half as
        much ammonia per P₂O₅ compared to DAP. No extra steps beyond those used
        for DAP granulation are needed, except that MAP granules are usually
        acid-washed in the scrubber due to their higher acidity. Off-gases are
        similarly scrubbed with acid to recover ammonia
      </p>

      <h2>TSP (0-46-0):</h2>
      <p>
        TSP is produced without ammonia. Instead, finely ground phosphate rock
        is mixed with high-purity phosphoric acid in a pug mill or cone mixer.
        The acid dissolves the rock, forming mainly mono- and di-calcium
        phosphate and leaving gypsum. For non-granular TSP, the resulting wet
        powder is discharged onto a belt or curing area, where it “cures”
        (reacts slowly) for days to weeks, producing dry, powdery TSP. For
        granular TSP, the slurry is sprayed onto seed granules (small sand or
        recycled material) to build up size. The granules are then cured and
        screened. TSP contains no nitrogen but has ~15% calcium and is strongly
        acidic (pH of slurry ~2).
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific principles:</h2>
      <p>
        In DAP/MAP, neutralization reactions occur (acid–base), and granulation
        relies on nucleation and crystallization as the slurry cools. The pH of
        the reaction is managed to control particle formation. TSP production is
        essentially another acidulation step: excess phosphoric acid dissolves
        rock phosphate, so the same solubility rules apply. Curing allows
        residual acid to fully react with rock.
      </p>
      <h2>Environmental considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        Ammonia slip and dust are key concerns. Modern plants use scrubbers:
        packed towers or venturi scrubbers that use recycled acid to capture
        ammonia and particulates. Particulate filters capture dust from
        granulators and dryers. All ammonia in off-gas is recovered to minimize
        emissions. Wet scrubbers may produce dilute ammonium sulfate, which can
        be sold or recycled. Energy integration is common: the heat from
        ammoniation can preheat incoming acid or produce steam. Water use is
        moderate, limited to cooling.
      </p>
      <h2>Infrastructure integration:</h2>
      <p>
        The phosphoric acid (PAP plant output) and ammonia feed determine
        production rates. A local SAP/PAP complex ensures a steady acid supply.
        A captive Ammonia Plant (not detailed here) typically feeds NH₃. Power
        and steam from the plant’s cogeneration unit supply granulator heaters,
        driers, and kilns. Molten Sulfur Units and the SAP indirectly support
        fertilizer output by providing continuous acid. Gypsum from TSP and DAP
        (tendency to form small quantities during reaction) may be reused in
        other processes or stockpiled. The entire fertilizer complex is often
        integrated so that heat and material (like reclaimed acid) are shared
        among units.
