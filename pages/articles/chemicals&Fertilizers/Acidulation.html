        Transforming Rock to Acid: Phosphoric Acid Production through

      <p class="article-text">
        Phosphoric acid is produced by acidulating phosphate rock with
        concentrated sulfuric acid. This wet-process converts tricalcium
        phosphate in the rock to soluble phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) and
        precipitates calcium sulfate (gypsum) as a byproduct. The reaction is
        highly exothermic: for example, apatite (Ca₅(PO₄)₃F) plus sulfuric acid
        yields H₃PO₄, gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O), and hydrofluoric acid. In practice,
        ground rock and ~93–98% H₂SO₄ are continuously fed to an acidulation
        reactor or digestion tower, where heat is managed by cooling. Gypsum
        crystals form in the slurry and are removed by large filters or
        centrifuges. The weak (∼25–30% P₂O₅) phosphoric acid solution leaving
        this step contains soluble impurities and is routed to purification and
        concentration.

      <h2>Process steps :</h2>
      <h3>Rock preparation:</h3>
      <p>Dry, crush and finely grind phosphate ore</p>
      <h3>Sulfuric acid addition:</h3>
      <p>
        Sulfuric acid (from the site SAP) is metered with precise rock feed.
      </p>
      <h3>Digestion:</h3>
      <p>
        In multi-stage digesters, rock reacts with H₂SO₄ to form H₃PO₄ and
        gypsum.
      </p>
      <h3>Filtration :</h3>
      <p>
        The slurry is filtered; gypsum (phosphogypsum) is washed thoroughly
        (typically >99% acid recovery) and dewatered.
      </p>
      <h3>Acid output :</h3>
      <p>
        The filtrate (“weak acid”) containing 20–30% H₃PO₄ and soluble
        impurities (F⁻, Mg²⁺, Al³⁺, etc.) is collected.
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific principles:</h2>
      <p>
        The main reaction is an acid–base type where Ca in rock reacts with
        sulfate to form insoluble gypsum, freeing the phosphoric acid.
        Solubility drives gypsum precipitation (CaSO₄ is sparingly soluble)
        while H₃PO₄ remains in solution. Heat management is critical because the
        reaction generates heat; higher temperatures increase reaction rates but
        can also lead to unwanted side reactions or scaling.
      </p>

      <h2>Infrastructure integration:</h2>
      <p>
        Integrated fertilizer complexes include Molten Sulfur Units to melt
        elemental sulfur and feed the Sulfuric Acid Plant (SAP), which produces
        the 93–98% H₂SO₄ for acidulation. Sulfuric acid is stored in large acid
        tanks (Sulfuric Acid Storage) before use. Desalination/Freshwater Plants
        supply process water for mixing with acid and washing gypsum. Excess
        heat from the SAP (from cooling towers or condensers) may be used in a
        nearby Power Plant or desalination unit. For example, one facility was
        designed with a 3000 mt/d SAP delivering 98.5% acid via a buffer tank to
        a 650 mt/d Phosphoric Acid Plant.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        The byproduct gypsum (phosphogypsum) is produced in large quantities and
        often stockpiled; it contains impurities (F, Ra) and must be managed
        carefully. Wastewater from filtration and cooling is acidic with
        dissolved phosphate and fluoride; modern plants recycle this water in
        cooling ponds to reuse water and minimize discharge. Acid mists and
        volatile HF (from fluorapatite) are scrubbed or absorbed – for example,
        industrial designs include fluorine-absorption units that capture HF to
        produce fluosilicic acid. Strict containment and water treatment ensure
        any overflow or leachate meets environmental standards. Using
        high-purity acid (93–98%) and automatic controls optimizes efficiency
        and reduces energy needed for later evaporation. Overall, acidulation is
        resource- and energy-intensive but indispensable: phosphoric acid
        “serves as a pivotal intermediate” for downstream fertilizers like DAP
        and NPK.
