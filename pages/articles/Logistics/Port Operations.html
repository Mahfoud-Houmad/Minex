      <h1>Gateway to the World: Port Operations for Phosphate Exports</h1>

      <p class="article-text">
        Exports of phosphate products rely on Morocco’s modern port terminals.
        The primary export port for fertilizers is Jorf Lasfar, which sits on
        the Atlantic coast. This terminal has large storage yards (roofed silos
        and blending domes) near six berths. Finished fertilizers are fed to the
        berths via reclaim conveyors. Specialized shiploaders – telescoping belt
        conveyors – can load two vessels simultaneously at about 2,000
        tonnes/hour each. Sulfur and other bulk inputs have separate loaders.
        The port area covers ~5 km² and includes dust-collection units and
        conveyor covers. For phosphoric acid (and sulphuric acid), pipelines and
        pumps connect storage tanks directly to chemical tanker berths. Loading
        operations use enclosures or water curtains to suppress airborne dust.
        Fire-fighting monitors and spill-retention pools line the quay.
      </p>

      <h2>Jorf Lasfar (El Jadida):</h2>
      <p>
        Morocco’s largest fertilizer export terminal. It handles all grades of
        MAP/DAP/NPK. Equipped with dual shiploaders (2×2000 t/h) and conveyor
        bridges. Contained domes store bulk granules. Ships up to Panamax size
        (70–80k dwt) are routinely loaded. Environmental systems (fog cannons,
        sealed conveyors) minimize pollution during loading.
      </p>

      <h2>Safi:</h2>
      <p>
        A second OCP coastal facility, handling phosphate rock and fertilizer.
        Safi has its own reactors (acid plant) and docks for bulkers. An on-site
        rail link brings rock from Gantour mines to Safi’s washery and
        fertilizer plant, then conveyors to port wharves. Continuous ambient-air
        monitors and water-treatment units at Safi help control emissions.
      </p>

      <h2>Casablanca:</h2>
      <p>
        Historically a phosphate export port (Somaport terminal), it still ships
        mineral fertilizers and rock. A rail spur links Khouribga mine to
        Casablanca. On-deck conveyors and shiploaders (capacity ~1,500–2,000
        t/h) handle the bulk loads. Dust filters and port drainage systems
        mitigate contamination.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental Protections:</h2>
      <p>
        All OCP port terminals employ best practices. Dust is controlled by
        water sprays and cyclones; stormwater is routed through neutralization
        ponds. Storage areas have impervious floors and collection drains. OCP
        has implemented real-time dust monitoring and invested in “green port”
        technologies. Ships comply with MARPOL rules (e.g. no ballast water
        discharge). Solid waste and washdown water are treated or recycled.
        Regular audits (internal and regulatory) ensure adherence to
        environmental standards.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="article-text">
        The final-product stage of the phosphate chain combines engineered
        storage and transport systems with rigorous safety and sustainability
        measures. In Morocco, OCP’s integrated approach – from
        climate-controlled fertilizer halls and lined acid tanks to high-speed
        ship loaders and green port policies – ensures that billions of tonnes
        of phosphate products are delivered worldwide reliably and responsibly.
