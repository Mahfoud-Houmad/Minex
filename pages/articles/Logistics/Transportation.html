        Once prepared, finished fertilizers and acid are loaded for transport to
        export terminals or distribution centers. Within the plant complex,
        conveyors and elevators move product from storage to load-out points (at
        Jorf Lasfar there are over 100 conveyors linking production lines to the
        docks). From there:
      </p>

      <h2>Trucks:</h2>
      <p>
        Bulk fertilizer is hauled by covered bulk trucks or bagged product by
        flatbed semi-trailers with tarps. Phosphoric acid is transported in
        dedicated stainless-steel or HDPE-lined tank trucks. All vehicles meet
        ADR (UN) regulations for corrosive/hazardous goods: trucks carry spill
        kits, grounding cables, and drivers are specially trained. Loaders use
        dust-free hoppers and secured fittings.
      </p>

      <h2>Rail:</h2>
      <p>
        Heavy cargoes (especially to domestic distribution centers) use rail.
        Covered hopper wagons carry granulated fertilizers (to keep them dry),
        while pressure-rated tank cars carry acid. Morocco’s ONCF railway has
        direct spurs from plants (e.g. Benguerir → Safi, Khouribga → Jorf
        Lasfar). Rail transport allows large batch shipments with strict
        scheduling.
      </p>

      <h2>Conveyors:</h2>
      <p>
        On-site belt conveyors or pipe conveyors (e.g. Morocco’s 102 km slurry
        pipeline for ore) also move products. At Jorf Lasfar the fertilizer
        lines tie directly into quay conveyors for ship loading. Conveyors are
        fitted with safety pull-cords, slip/stop sensors and covered belts to
        contain dust.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="article-text">
        All transport operations follow strict safety and efficiency protocols.
        Vehicles are weighed on automatic weighbridges. Routing is optimized
        (with GPS tracking) to reduce distance and emissions. Loading/unloading
        areas have ventilation and spill containment. Digital systems track each
        shipment’s origin, batch and destination to ensure traceability. During
        loading, personnel monitor for leaks or dust. Spill response teams stand
        by at distribution points, and emergency exercises are regularly
        conducted. Efficiency is also achieved by consolidating loads – for
        example, grouping fertilizer grades by port destination – and by
        coordinating train and ship schedules to minimize idle time and
        demurrage.
