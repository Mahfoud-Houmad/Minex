      <p class="article-text">
        Finished phosphate fertilizers are typically stored indoors in
        large-scale facilities to protect them from rain and humidity. Common
        setups include vertical bulk silos (steel or concrete) and covered
        storage halls or tension-fabric buildings. These structures are designed
        to be weather-tight; incoming product is immediately shuttled in by
        conveyor or pneumatic blower to prevent exposure. Humidity control is
        critical, because phosphate fertilizers are hygroscopic and will cake or
        lose granularity if they absorb moisture. Industry guidance recommends
        maintaining around 35±5% relative humidity at ~27 °C in fertilizer
        warehouses. Climate-control systems (dehumidifiers, ventilation fans)
        and insulation help keep conditions stable. Safety features such as
        dust-collection hoods, inert gas purging, and explosion-proof motors are
        often used to prevent combustible dust risks (especially for
        nitrate-based fertilizers). Inventory is managed using automated
        weighbridges, bin-level sensors and computerized stock-tracking, which
        enforce first-in-first-out (FIFO) rotation and precise batch control.

      <h2>Storage types:</h2>
      <p>
        Bulk silos (for dry granules) and covered halls (precast or fabric roof)
        are common. Silos may have discharge chutes feeding conveyors. Fabric
        halls allow flexible expansion and equipment access.
      </p>

      <h2>Moisture control:</h2>
      <p>
        Maintain ~35% RH at ~27 °C. Any moisture (from leaks or humid air) is
        rapidly removed by fans/dehumidifiers to prevent caking.
      </p>

      <h2>Safety:</h2>
      <p>
        Dust collectors and vents prevent dust build-up. Lightning protection,
        fire extinguishers and segregation of incompatible chemicals (e.g.
        nitrates from sulfurs) are used.
      </p>

      <h2>Inventory management:</h2>
      <p>
        Automated scales and RFID tracking monitor stock levels. Samples are
        regularly tested, and age of material is recorded to ensure quality.
