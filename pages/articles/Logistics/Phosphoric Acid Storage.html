      <p class="article-text">
        Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is stored in dedicated tank farms built with
        corrosion-resistant materials. Tanks are typically constructed of 316L
        stainless steel (extra-low-carbon) or fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP),
        often with rubber linings or coating (e.g. chlorobutyl). These materials
        withstand the acid’s corrosiveness. Tank farms include level gauges,
        pressure-relief vents and closed-loop recirculation systems. All tanks
        sit inside a dike (bund) – an earthen or concrete containment wall
        around the tank area – designed to hold at least 110% of the largest
        tank’s volume. The bunded floor slopes to a sump so that any leaked acid
        can be pumped out safely. Acid loading points have spill panels and
        neutralization stations (e.g. with lime), and tank vents are piped to
        scrubbers or neutralizing towers. Redundant pumps, automated fill
        alarms, and remote monitoring ensure early leak detection and alarm any
        overfill. Regular inspections check for corrosion or leaks on tank
        walls, piping and fittings.
      </p>

      <h2>Tank materials :</h2>
      <p>
        316L stainless steel with high nickel content is preferred. FRP or
        high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tanks are also used (per industry
        guides, phosphoric acid tanks are made of HDPE or FRP to resist
        corrosion). Carbon steel must always be rubber-lined to survive acid
        contact.
      </p>

      <h2>Containment (diking):</h2>
      <p>
        The tank farm is fully bunded. Bund walls are sized for ≥110% of tank
        volume, and floors are lined (acid-proof) to prevent soil contamination.
        Sumps collect leaks for treatment.
      </p>

      <h2>Temperature control:</h2>
      <p>
        Concentrated phosphoric acid has a high freezing point, so tanks may
        require heat tracing. For example, 75% H₃PO₄ (≈ 54% P₂O₅) can be stored
        outdoors safely, but 80–85% grades may freeze at ambient temperatures.
        Low-temperature steam or hot-water circulation loops are installed to
        keep acid above freezing. Automated temperature and flow controls
        maintain safe levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Safety systems:</h2>
      <p>
        Vent gas scrubbers or packed towers neutralize escaping fumes. Flame and
        vapor detectors monitor the area. Emergency neutralizer feed (lime, soda
        ash) and spill kits are on hand. Fire suppression systems (water spray
        with corrosion additives) protect tanks from external fire. Personnel
        working around the tanks must use acid-resistant PPE and follow strict
        safety protocols.
