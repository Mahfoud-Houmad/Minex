        Exploration begins with regional geological synthesis and remote sensing
        to delineate phosphatic horizons, followed by geophysical surveys
        (gravity, resistivity, seismic) to map subsurface structure. Targets are
        tested with systematic core drilling; core logging yields lithology,
        P₂O₅ grade, thickness and rock quality data. These inputs feed
        geostatistical and 3-D reserve models used for resource classification
        and pit design. Simultaneous hydrogeological and environmental baseline
        programs determine water table depths, recharge dynamics and ecological
        constraints to inform responsible mine planning.

      <h2>Regional Mapping & Remote Sensing</h2>
      <p>
        Regional mapping and satellite imagery are used to locate outcrops,
        structural trends and surface alteration that point to phosphatic
        horizons. High-resolution satellite imagery, aerial photography and
        geological maps identify surface exposures and structural lineaments.
        Digital elevation models and multispectral data help distinguish
        lithologies and identify accessible drill targets. Mapping integrates
        historic borehole data and field reconnaissance to prioritise survey
        grids. These mapping products underpin the first-pass resource potential
        estimates and guide the design of follow-up geophysical programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Geophysical Surveys</h2>
      <p>
        Geophysical methods (gravity, resistivity, shallow seismic) are
        essential to define subsurface geometry and to detect water-bearing
        units that influence mine design. Gravity surveys map density contrasts
        associated with phosphatic horizons; electrical resistivity and induced
        polarisation detect conductive clay or water-filled layers. Shallow
        seismic profiles reveal bedding geometry and faulting. Geophysics
        reduces drilling uncertainty and helps outline areas of “disturbance”
        (hard lenses or clay pods) that could complicate extraction. Data are
        integrated with borehole logs to refine 3-D geological models and
        hydrogeological risk maps.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Drilling & Sampling</h2>
      <p>
        Core drilling provides the hard data—rock samples and continuous
        logs—that confirm grade, thickness and rock quality for reserve
        estimation. Drilling programs follow grid or fence patterns, with core
        logging recording lithology, mineralization, structural features and
        water inflow. Representative core samples are sent to assaying labs for
        P₂O₅ and impurity analyses. Drilling density is increased in
        higher-confidence resource categories; results populate borehole
        databases used for variography and geostatistics. Chain-of-custody and
        QA/QC (standards, blanks, duplicates) are enforced to ensure sample
        reliability for reserve reporting.
      </p>

      <h2>Hydrogeological & Environmental Baseline</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding groundwater and the environmental baseline is critical
        before any pit is advanced—both for permitting and for practical
        dewatering design. Hydrogeological programs install piezometers, run
        pumping tests and measure aquifer transmissivity and hydraulic
        gradients. Results determine dewatering needs, potential inflows to pits
        and impacts on nearby water users. Environmental baseline studies
        measure existing water quality, terrestrial and aquatic ecology, and
        seasonal variability. Combined, these studies define water management
        measures (cut-off drains, dewatering wells, treatment) and mitigation
        plans required by regulators and lenders.
