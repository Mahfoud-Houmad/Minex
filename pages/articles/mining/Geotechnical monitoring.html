      <h1>Keeping the Pit Safe: Geotechnical Monitoring and Slope Stability</h1>

      <p class="article-text">
        Continuous monitoring of pit walls and tailings ensures early detection
        of instability and supports safe operations.
        Instrumentation—piezometers, extensometers, slope radar and survey
        prisms—tracks displacement, pore pressures and acceleration. Data
        integrate to slope stability models and trigger thresholds (traffic
        restriction, dewatering increase, bench re-design). Regular geotechnical
        inspections complement instrument monitoring; recorded trends inform
        long-term pit sequencing and rehabilitation design.

      <h2>Environmental & Social Management</h2>
      <p>
        ESMS guides how the project minimises environmental harm and engages
        communities — covering baseline studies, monitoring, grievance
        mechanisms and benefit sharing. An Environmental and Social Management
        System includes an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), monitoring
        programs, community engagement plans, grievance mechanisms and
        livelihood restoration where required. It sets performance indicators,
        reporting frequency, roles and responsibilities and links to corporate
        sustainability objectives. Transparent disclosure and local hiring
        programs strengthen the social licence to operate.
      </p>

      <h2>EMP / Baseline & Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        The EMP documents impact mitigation, monitoring schedules and legal
        compliance responsibilities for the mine. EMP elements include water and
        air quality monitoring, biodiversity management, waste handling, noise
        control and monitoring frequencies. Baseline datasets define pre-impact
        conditions against which operational impacts are measured. The EMP
        specifies corrective actions, reporting lines and adaptive management
        measures where monitoring shows deviations from expected performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Community Engagement & Grievance Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        Sustained two-way engagement builds trust; grievance systems provide a
        transparent way for concerns to be raised and resolved. Engagement plans
        include regular consultations, local hiring targets, community
        development programs and transparent grievance channels. Grievances are
        logged, investigated within set timelines and outcomes communicated.
        Social impact monitoring tracks indicators such as employment, income
        changes and health outcomes. Capacity building (training, supplier
        development) helps spread economic benefits beyond the mine
