        Blast engineers design hole spacing, burden and depth based on rock
        competency and the required fragmentation size for downstream loading
        and crushing. Explosive selection (emulsion, ANFO, packaged explosives)
        and precise initiation systems (electronic delay detonators) are used to
        control blast sequencing. Real-time monitoring of PPV and airblast is
        standard near communities and sensitive infrastructure. Misfire
        protocols, flyrock prevention and post-blast inspection are part of a
        formal blast management plan aligned with best practice guidance.
      </p>

      <h2>Blast Design & Drill Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Blast design selects hole diameter, spacing and timing to produce the
        target fragmentation curve and minimise vibration and airblast.
        Designers compute burden and spacing from bench geometry and the rock’s
        specific charge strength; hole diameter commonly ranges with the scale
        of operation. Electronic delay detonators enable precise millisecond
        timing to produce constructive/destructive wave interactions that reduce
        peak vibration while optimising rock breakage. Blast designs are
        validated by fragmentation monitoring (image analysis) and vibration
        logging; iterations continue until energy use and crushing costs reach
        targets.
      </p>

      <h2>Explosive Types & Initiation Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Explosive selection and reliable initiation systems are central to
        effective, safe blasting operations. Common modern choices include
        pumped emulsion products for in-hole charging, ANFO where conditions
        permit, and electronic initiation systems for precision timing.
        Initiation systems are stored and handled according to strict
        regulations; authorised blasters execute loading using written
        procedures to avoid sympathetic detonation. Selection balances safety,
        cost, ease of use and desired fragmentation characteristics
      </p>

      <h2>Monitoring (PPV / Airblast)</h2>
      <p>
        Monitoring ensures blasts remain within regulatory vibration and
        airblast limits and provides feedback for design refinement. Portable or
        permanent seismographs log PPV at strategic locations; microbarographs
        record airblast. Data are compared to allowable thresholds for
        structures and human comfort; exceedances trigger investigations and
        design changes. Vibration monitoring enables correlation with blast
        parameters (charge weight, delay timing), improving future fragmentation
        and minimising community impact. Records form part of permitting and
        community engagement documentation.
      </p>

      <h2>Misfire Management & Post-blast Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        Post-blast safety focuses on detecting and safely disposing of misfires,
        inspecting the blast site and recording results. Standard misfire
        procedures require a waiting period before approach, followed by visual
        and electronic detection. Trained crews clear debris and execute safety
        detonations or remove charges under controlled conditions. Post-blast
        surveys document fragmentation, flyrock, and any environmental or
        structural impacts; blast records (design, weather, delays, measured
        PPV) are retained for audit and continuous improvement.
