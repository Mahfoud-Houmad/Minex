        Mine dewatering helps manage water levels so mining operations can run
        smoothly and say on schedule, following what’s been planned by the
        engineering plan.
      </p>

      <p class="article-text">
        A layered dust control programme couples source controls (enclosures,
        sprays), roadway treatments (water trucks, hygroscopic binders) and
        operational measures (speed limits, wheel washes). Continuous PM
        monitoring (PM10/PM2.5) at critical receptors and meteorological
        stations allows dynamic responses (increase suppression during high
        winds). Records of interventions and community complaints feed
        continuous improvement and compliance reporting.
      </p>

      <h2>Dust Suppression Techniques (sprinklers, misting, binders)</h2>
      <p>
        Use water, misting, chemical binders and localized capture to prevent
        dust liberation at source. Sprinklers and misting cannons suppress dust
        at crushers, stockpiles and transfer points. Road binders (calcium
        chloride, lignosulfonates) stabilise surfaces to reduce resuspension;
        surfactants improve water efficiency. Enclosures and local ventilation
        capture dust for extraction and filtration where feasible. Choice of
        technique balances effectiveness, water availability and environmental
        impacts of binders
      </p>

      <h2>Road Maintenance & Stabilisation</h2>
      <p>
        Well-maintained internal roads reduce dust generation and operating
        costs. Regular grading, application of stabilising material and planned
        watering schedules keep surfaces firm. High-use routes may be paved or
        chemically stabilised. Drainage and surfacing prevent rutting and
        ponding that break surface cohesion. Road maintenance KPIs include %
        roads graded per week and litres of water applied per km.
      </p>

      <h2>Air Quality Monitoring (PM10/PM2.5)</h2>
      <p>
        Continuous or periodic measurement of particulate matter ensures
        compliance and helps trigger suppression actions. Fixed monitoring
        stations record PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at strategic points;
        portable monitors are used for spot checks. Data dashboards show trends
        and trigger alarms if thresholds are exceeded. Correlating PM spikes
        with operations (blasting, high winds, crushing) allows targeted
        mitigation. Public dashboards and complaint logs improve transparency
        with local stakeholders.
