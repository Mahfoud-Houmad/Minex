        Excavation involves the systematic removal of overburden (non-ore
        material) and phosphate ore using a combination of drilling, blasting,
        and mechanical loading. The process is carefully planned to optimise ore
        recovery, maintain slope stability, and minimise environmental impact.
        Detailed mine plans dictate the sequence of excavation, bench heights,
        and pit geometries, while geotechnical monitoring ensures slope safety.
        Excavation also includes stockpiling of different material types
        (overburden, low-grade ore) for future use or rehabilitation.
      </p>

      <h2>Overburden Removal & Stockpiling</h2>
      <p>
        Overburden (soil and rock above the phosphate seam) is removed in
        controlled layers and temporarily stored for site rehabilitation or
        backfilling. Excavation follows a bench-by-bench approach to maintain
        stability. Stockpiles are placed on stable, low-erosion areas, contoured
        to reduce runoff and seeded if storage is long-term. GPS and volume
        tracking ensures accurate placement and future reuse. Measures prevent
        contamination from fuels or oils, preserving soil for eventual
        reclamation.
      </p>

      <h2>Ore Excavation & Handling</h2>
      <p>
        Phosphate ore is extracted using hydraulic excavators, loaders, and haul
        trucks. Ore is selectively mined to maintain grade control, separating
        high-grade material from lower-grade or waste rock. Loading sequences
        minimise truck travel and fuel consumption. Ore stockpiles are
        constructed with controlled compaction and drainage to prevent erosion
        or waterlogging. Sampling and quality testing occur continuously to
        ensure compliance with processing specifications.
      </p>

      <h2>Slope & Safety Management</h2>
      <p>
        Pit walls are designed to stable angles based on rock type, depth, and
        geotechnical assessments. Benches are maintained with proper width to
        allow machinery access. Safety berms and catch benches prevent
        accidental rockfalls. Monitoring equipment (inclinometers, piezometers)
        tracks slope movement and groundwater pressures. Emergency evacuation
        routes and clear signage are maintained throughout the excavation area.
      </p>

      <h2>Water & Environmental Management</h2>
      <p>
        Excavation activities are integrated with water and sediment control
        measures to protect downstream ecosystems. Runoff from benches and
        stockpiles is directed to sedimentation ponds or channels. Oil/water
        separators are installed for workshops and refuelling areas. Dust
        suppression (water sprays, windbreaks) mitigates particulate emissions.
        Progressive rehabilitation involves backfilling low-grade overburden and
        regrading disturbed areas.
