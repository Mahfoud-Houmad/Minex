        Primary crushers reduce run-of-mine rock to a manageable size before
        washing and trommelling remove clays and slimes. Size classification
        (screens, cyclones) separates coarse product from fines; fines are
        directed to grinding/flotation circuits for concentrate production. In
        Morocco, washed ore is frequently turned into slurry and pumped via
        pipelines to centralized chemical complexes—a model that concentrates
        greenhouse gas-intensive chemical processing at coastal hubs while
        reducing haulage impacts. Thickening and tailings handling at the mine
        recover water for reuse.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Crushing</h2>
      <p>
        Primary crushing reduces ore size so washing and screening can work
        efficiently and downstream grinders are fed at controlled rates. Primary
        gyratory or jaw crushers reduce large boulders to a crusher product size
        suitable for conveyors and wash plants. Crushers are followed by
        scalping screens to bypass oversize and protect downstream equipment.
        Design focuses on throughput, ease of maintenance and dust controls
        (enclosures and spray bars). Redundancy and controlled feed rates ensure
        continuous plant throughput.
      </p>

      <h2>Washing & Screening (trommels, log washers)</h2>
      <p>
        Washing removes sticky clays and fines that hamper beneficiation and
        transport; screening sorts material for the next stage. Trommel screens
        and log washers agitate and wash material, separating clay and mud balls
        from rock; water and attrition break down slimes. Screens classify
        sizes; overflow and underflow streams are managed into thickeners or
        fines circuits. Water balance is critical—plant design emphasises
        recycle and recovery to minimise freshwater intake. These steps increase
        downstream recovery and avoid pipeline or rail plugging.
      </p>

      <h2>Classification (cyclones, screens)</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanical classification separates particle sizes to route material to
        appropriate processing or storage. Cyclones and screens separate coarse,
        sand-sized and fine fractions. Coarse product may be stockpiled for
        direct shipment; sands and fines proceed to grinding and flotation.
        Cyclone underflow densities are controlled by pump speeds and feed
        solids; classification efficiency strongly impacts flotation performance
        and overall recovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Grinding & Flotation (when required)</h2>
      <p>
        Flotation recovers fine phosphates that washing alone cannot liberate;
        grinding prepares material to the required liberation size. Grinding
        reduces particle size to expose phosphate mineral surfaces; reagents
        (collectors, frothers) and aeration enable phosphate-rich particles to
        attach to bubbles and be recovered as concentrate. Multiple rougher and
        cleaner stages improve grade; concentrates pass to thickeners and
        filters while tailings are managed in tailings systems. Flotation
        chemistry and residence time optimisation determine recovery and product
        quality
      </p>
      <h2>Slurry Preparation & Pipeline Feed</h2>
      <p>
        Where used, slurry pipelines convey washed ore over long distances to
        central processing hubs—reducing truck/rail loads. Slurry is prepared by
        mixing washed solids with water to a controlled density then pumped to
        terminal facilities using booster stations. Key controls include
        particle size distribution, slurry density, wear-resistant piping and
        monitoring systems for solids concentration and flow. Morocco’s
        Khouribga→Jorf Lasfar slurry pipeline is an established example of
        centralised processing enabled by pipeline logistics. Design mitigates
        abrasion and ensures efficient energy use per tonne transported.
      </p>
      <h2>Tailings & Water Recovery (thickeners)</h2>
      <p>
        Tailings management concentrates residual solids and recovers water for
        re-use; adequate design avoids long-term environmental liabilities.
        Thickeners and filters reduce the water content of tailings; clarified
        overflow is recycled to the process circuit. Tailings storage facilities
        (TSFs) are engineered with liners, seepage controls and monitoring. Some
        operations investigate value-adding for fines (cement additives, soil
        amendments) to reduce tailings mass. Continuous monitoring (pore
        pressure, slope stability) and progressive reclamation are best practice
        to minimise risk.
