        Effective loading and hauling requires matching excavator/shovel bucket
        size to truck payload, optimising cycle times and payload utilisation.
        Road geometry, grades and passing bays minimise queuing; fleet
        telematics provide utilisation, idle time and fuel consumption metrics.
        Operational techniques (push loading, spot loading) and tyre/fuel
        management reduce unit costs. A structured maintenance program preserves
        availability and predictable productivity in harsh pit conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Shovel-Truck Matching & Fleet Sizing</h2>
      <p>
        Choose equipment combinations that hit production targets with minimal
        idle time and fuel penalty. Designers size fleets by calculating
        required tonnes/hour, truck cycle time and loader fill time; excavator
        bucket must match truck payload for efficient single-pass loading. Fleet
        simulations and load-haul analysis determine number of trucks, spare
        ratios and shift coverage. Modern operations use telematics to refine
        matching over time and to plan equipment purchases or redeployment.
      </p>

      <h2>Loading Techniques & Cycle Optimisation</h2>
      <p>
        Loading method influences cycle time, tyre life and fragmentation
        needs—optimisation improves productivity across the pit. Techniques
        include spot loading, push loading and pre-charging, chosen based on
        layout, fragmentation and truck type. Operators are trained for
        consistent bucket fill, reducing multiple passes and tyre wear. Cycle
        time is minimised by optimising queue management, staging areas and by
        ensuring predictable shovel availability; telemetry metrics drive
        continuous improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>Internal Roads & Route Design</h2>
      <p>
        Road maintenance and design control travel time, safety and operating
        costs for haulage fleets. Roads are engineered with appropriate
        crossfall, drainage and compaction to support truck loads and to
        minimise erosion. Regular grading and maintenance schedules, controlled
        speeds and designated passing bays reduce incidents and rolling
        resistance. Use of stabilising binders in high-traffic areas extends
        maintenance intervals; wheelwash stations at site exits prevent off-site
        sediment transfer.
      </p>

      <h2>Fleet Management & Telematics</h2>
      <p>
        Telematics provide the data needed to manage productivity, fuel use and
        maintenance planning for hundreds of mobile assets. Fleet management
        systems track location, engine hours, fuel burn, idle time and load
        cycles in real time, enabling dispatch optimisation and predictive
        maintenance. Analytics identify bottlenecks (waiting at shovel,
        queuing), support tyre management programs and allow KPI dashboards for
        supervisors. Integration with pit planning software aligns haulage flows
        to short-term production schedules.
      </p>
      <h2>Maintenance & Safety Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        Routine maintenance and safety inspections keep heavy equipment
        available and reduce risks on site. Preventive maintenance schedules,
        daily pre-start checks, tyre pressure monitoring and condition-based
        alerts reduce breakdowns and catastrophic failures. Lock-out/tag-out,
        isolation procedures and operator training on slope travel and braking
        are core safety elements. Incident reporting, root cause analysis and
        continuous training underpin a mature safety culture.
