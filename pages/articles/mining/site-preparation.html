      <p class="article-text">
        Preparation includes detailed survey and geotechnical investigations,
        topsoil stripping and stockpiling (for later rehabilitation),
        construction of access roads and work platforms engineered for heavy
        loads, and installation of temporary camps and fuel/storage facilities
        with containment. Designers put in place erosion and sediment control
        structures (silt traps, retention basins) and a drainage system sized
        for storm events. All works are documented and mapped to ensure topsoil
        is conserved and environmental impacts are minimised during operations.
      </p>

      <h2>Topsoil Management (decapage & stockage)</h2>
      <p>
        Topsoil (the fertile surface layer) must be removed carefully and stored
        for future site reclamation and rehabilitation. Topsoil stripping is
        sequenced prior to earthworks; stockpiles are sited on stable ground,
        battened against erosion and seeded if storage is long-term. Soil
        handling records (volumes, GPS locations, layer depths) are kept to
        ensure the correct material is re-used during progressive rehab. Good
        practice minimises topsoil compaction and contamination (fuel spills)
        and includes testing to confirm suitability for revegetation.
      </p>

      <h2>Access Roads & Working Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Road design controls gradient, curvature and surface material to reduce
        tyre wear and fuel use; grades are typically kept under 8–10% where
        possible. Platforms (pads) for crushers, wash plants and workshops are
        constructed with engineered sub-bases and geotextiles to prevent
        settlement. Drainage, culverts and retention structures prevent erosion.
        High-traffic areas may receive stabilising binders or bituminous
        surfacing to limit dust and maintenance needs
      </p>

      <h2>Temporary Infrastructures (camps, fuel, workshops)</h2>
      <p>
        Temporary infrastructure supports construction and early operations but
        must be sited and managed to limit environmental risk. Temporary works
        include accommodation, workshops, fuel farms with bunded containment,
        water treatment units and emergency response stations. Fuel and chemical
        storages use double-bunds and leak detection; wash bays are connected to
        proper wastewater treatment. Contractor camps follow occupational health
        standards, and logistics for workforce transport are planned to reduce
        traffic impacts. All temporary infrastructure is included in
        decommissioning and reclamation plans
      </p>

      <h2>Erosion & Water Management (retention basins, drains)</h2>
      <p>
        Stormwater and process water control protects downstream receptors and
        prevents sediment loading of streams. Stormwater systems include
        diversion drains, sedimentation basins sized for local rainfall
        intensity, and oil/water separators for workshop outlets. Runoff from
        stockpiles is channelled to settling ponds; turbidity and pH monitoring
        points ensure discharge meets permit limits. Temporary measures (silt
        fences, coir logs) are used during construction and are progressively
        replaced by permanent structures as sites mature
